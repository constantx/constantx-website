Serial Ï€-shaped founder with a 15-year track record of building stuff that matters. I excel in turning complex problems into elegant solutions through product design and engineering.

Launched multiple ventures across the US, Canada, and Vietnam. Currently diving deep into web3 and applied AI for decentralized social networks, because apparently regular AI wasn't challenging enough.

I thrive in the negative-one-to-one phase, where uncertainty is the only certainty. My approach? Design thinking meets engineering pragmatism, with a healthy dose of lean methodology.

When I'm not shipping code or pitching decks, you'll find me obsessing over typography, deconstructing game mechanics, or getting an adrenaline fix by deploying my parachute instead of to production.

Let's build something that makes people's lives meaningfully better.
