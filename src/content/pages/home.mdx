Building products that solve real problems and improve people's lives. Currently exploring AI and web3 applications.

15 years launching companies from zero to one, turning complex challenges into simple solutions through design and engineering. Built ventures across the US, Canada, and Vietnam.

Thriving in the messy early stages where nothing is certain yet. Combining design thinking with practical engineering and lean startup principles.

When not coding or pushing pixels, nerding out over typography, analyzing game design, or skydiving.

Let's create something meaningful together.​
