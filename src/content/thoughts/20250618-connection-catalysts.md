## Key Takeaways

- **20% of U.S. adults experience daily loneliness** while AI systems reach billion-dollar valuations—a convergence that could reshape human relationships
- **AI agents can bridge cultural, linguistic, and social barriers** that prevent authentic human connection
- **The real opportunity isn't AI replacing human connection, but AI facilitating the conditions where humans connect better**
- **Early applications show 63.3% of users report reduced loneliness** when AI focuses on enhancing rather than substituting human relationships
- **Success depends on designing for human flourishing over engagement metrics**—we need builders who prioritize connection quality over platform addiction

I'm returning to founder mode. This newly refreshed site will serve as a public experiment space and thoughts journal—a place to share what I'm learning as I build.

Since 2024, after exiting my last venture (Chopp, an on-demand grocery startup), I've focused on what matters most: health, friends, and family. I read voraciously now—aiming for 50 books this year and already on number 27. Reading has been transformative, but that's a topic for another post.

The freedom reminded me of college time—pure curiosity without commercial pressure. This past year, I helped ship an AI agent for college students, built an AI-powered Chrome extension for recruiter, explored AI agent simulations, experimented with generative UI, and dove back into computer graphics with ThreeJS and GLSL. I was doing what people now call "vibe coding" before it had a name.

Each experiment taught me something crucial: **AI's highest potential lies in enhancing human experiences, not replacing them**. Now, working on something new in the AI and social space, that insight drives everything.

The convergence is striking: **One in five Americans experiences daily loneliness**[^1] while AI systems serve 90% of Fortune 500 companies[^2]. Most see unrelated trends. I see connected opportunity.

## When Technology Amplifies Isolation

Think about Theodore in _Her_—surrounded by technology yet profoundly alone. The AI doesn't create his loneliness; it reveals what was already there.

This is today's reality. **77% of women and 66% of men have experienced catfishing**[^3]. Language barriers prevent meaningful connections. Social anxiety keeps millions isolated. Cultural misunderstandings fragment communities.

Current platforms exploit these gaps. Dating apps optimize for engagement, not relationships. Social algorithms create echo chambers that feel connected but aren't.

What if we approached it differently?

## AI as Bridge Builder

The breakthrough isn't building better AI companions. It's **using AI to create conditions where humans connect authentically**.

**Breaking Language Barriers**: AI conveys cultural context and emotional undertones, not just words. Two people speaking different languages could have deep conversations where personality shines through.

**Confidence Scaffolding**: For social anxiety, AI provides practice conversations, suggests topics based on shared interests, or offers real-time coaching. The goal is building skills for human friendship.

**Authentic Matching**: Instead of showing everyone nearby, AI identifies compatible communication styles and complementary perspectives. Quality over quantity.

Like the robots in _Wall-E_—technology that brings isolated humans back together rather than replacing connection.

Starting from first principles: what do people fundamentally need from relationships?

**Belonging** comes from being seen and accepted. AI can identify genuine commonalities—shared values, humor styles, life perspectives that create real resonance.

**Understanding** requires clear communication across differences. AI excels at translation between languages, personality types, and cultural backgrounds.

**Growth** happens through diverse perspectives. Rather than echo chambers, AI could introduce viewpoints that expand beliefs.

**Authentic reciprocity** remains uniquely human. But AI can create conditions for safe vulnerability and genuine exchange.

## Early Signs

Current applications hint at this potential. **Oracle Health's AI saves physicians 66 minutes daily**[^4]—time redirected toward patients. **AI verification blocks 95% of fake dating profiles**[^5], creating trustworthy spaces.

**63.3% of thoughtfully designed AI companion users report reduced loneliness**[^6]. "Thoughtfully designed" matters. Systems focused on skill-building show different outcomes than those optimized for dependency.

The difference is intentional design for human flourishing versus attention capture.

The dangers are real. **25% of young adults believe AI could replace human relationships entirely**[^7]. Some users report decreased human support—a concerning substitution effect.

But these aren't inevitable—they're design choices.

Think _The Social Dilemma_: platforms optimizing for engagement over wellbeing. The next generation could invert this—measuring success by human flourishing, not platform metrics.

The crucial difference: exit strategy. Instead of maximizing time-on-platform, we need AI that becomes less necessary as human relationships strengthen.

## Building Differently

The path forward requires different success metrics. Instead of engagement rates, measure relationship quality. Instead of user retention, graduate people to stronger human connections.

Picture AI systems that:

- **Help anxious individuals practice conversations** before real-world interactions
- **Bridge cultural gaps** while preserving authenticity
- **Facilitate meaningful introductions** based on genuine compatibility
- **Provide relationship insights** for deepening existing connections
- **Create safe spaces** for vulnerable, accurate communication

This isn't about perfect AI relationships. It's about using AI to create conditions for beautifully imperfect human ones.

## Next

AI will reshape human relationships—that's certain. The question is whether it enhances authentic connection or provides sophisticated alternatives.

The technical foundation exists. **AI demonstrates sophisticated communication capabilities**[^8]. Billions flow toward these technologies. The tools are ready.

What we need: builders, researchers, and advocates who understand that artificial intelligence's highest purpose might be making human connection more accessible and authentic.

If you're working in this space, I'd love to connect. The challenges are significant, but so is the potential.

Because ultimately, we're not trying to build better AI relationships. We're trying to build AI that makes human relationships better.
