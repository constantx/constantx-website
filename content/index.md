True farm boy from Vietnam turned entrepreneurial product designer & hacker. Currently founder/CEO at [Chopp](https://angel.co/chopp), hustling & hacking between San Francisco & Vancouver. Lucky to be a part of Carbon, Axiom Zen, Zenhub, Etsy, and my first loveâ€”Threadsy (acquired by Facebook). 

Consulting for early stage startups on design and product development. When not hacking and pushing pixels, I study game mechanics or jump out of planes somewhere. 

I'm writing again on [Medium](https://medium.com/@constantx).
