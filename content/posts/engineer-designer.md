> engineer !== designer

Often that I hear people talking about design as if it's only what you see. If you know what you're doing, your team probably already have a design team or engineering team.

But here's a kicker: there's only one team. Your designers could be "engineering experience" and your engineers could be said to be "designing in code".

I haven’t written anything for a long time, ever since we started out new adventure by leaving San Francisco behind in May 2012. It’s been a year since then. Between then and now, we’ve moved to NYC, moved back to SF, left the US altogether to be in Vietnam, and will soon be in US again for a few months before heading to Vancouver, CA.

I really vibe with this quote from Michael Lebowitz, founder and CEO of Big Spaceship:

> “Everything that isn’t made by nature has been designed. It’s how people make everything,”

There are absolutely unicorns out there.

I had my fair share of working with designers in Silicon Valley, who have no basic knowledge of the platform’s capability of what they’re designing for. And this is not just a single designers, there were actually 3 brains working and looking at the same design. The straw is when our lead iOS engineer had to question, and then educate the team on the topic.
