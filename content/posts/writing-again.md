I should have written more. Shamefully, my last entry on [tumblr](http://constantxbits.tumblr.com/) dated back in 12/2012, with something about water. We’ve been moving around a lot. Between then and now, we’ve tracked across the globe to Asia, road-tripped from Louisiana to Seattle, and crossed the border to Vancouver, BC.

## The Why
The design and startup communities has been crazy lately I found. You will find most of what I write are highly opinionated, and expose my mediocre non-native English writing skill.

With a background in communication design, I’ve been working and learning as a hybrid designer / engineer in Silicon Valley for half a decade, though my design career had started way before that. Worked with a handful of teams, co-founded 2 startups, made many mistakes, and learned many lessons along the way.

I hope you’ll find the lessons I learned useful and not making the same one in your startups, design or engineering journey. On the other hand, I’m not a native English speaker, please excuse and help me improve my writing.

> In the past few years, I actually wrote more than I ever did my entire life.

90% of which is internal communication and code on GitHub, with the other 10% in emails. They’re mostly about design and engineering. I questioned my own thinking, learned and debated with others while building web and mobile products. I had kept some topics and snippets saved on Medium as drafts, but never got around to publish them.

## Let’s reboot!
