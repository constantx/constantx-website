Do you really think your 4-year at an ivy league school would be enough for the next 40+ years of your life?

The world is constantly changing. We have [this](google glass link), [this](insert tesla link), and [this](insert raspberry pi link) in the last five years, four of which you’re spending your time trying to get that precious degree of yours. And for what? So you can scramble to find that elusive job to pay for the massive $20,000+ tuition money. That’s not even an ivy-league kind of tuition money.

> Going to school should not be seen as a privilege — rather — an opportunity to learn how to learn. And you can do that anywhere.

Want to know what they’re not teaching you in school? The importance of reading. It is the most essential habit masked by the setup of an academic environment. They asked you to read because the material will be on the test. Little did you know, without reading, you’re essentially paralyzed in this fast moving world.

I wasn’t a straight-A students in school.

The pace at which I learn (imho) is what surprised me the most. And for that, I thank the people who gave me the opportunity to take up those challenges which are bigger than myself.
